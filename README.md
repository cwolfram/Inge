# FUNCTION
`inge new`: adds a device to the inventory system

Parameters:
    --help  shows help. All you need basically

Inge currently features only an interactive mode. It is not yet possible to pass arguments on the command line because I don't know how to do that in a modular way.

# TODO
~~- import custom input options from config~~
- And then rewrite/import the warranty date function
- write checks if a serial number / inventory number already exists
- implement linked issues
- if the config file gets any more complicated, maybe I should use JSON or YAML
